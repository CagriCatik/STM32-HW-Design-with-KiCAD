## **1. Introduction to LiPo Battery Chargers**

### **1.1 Overview**

Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries are favored in applications like drones, portable electronics, and robotics due to their high energy density, lightweight properties, and flexibility. However, charging LiPo batteries requires meticulous management to prevent overcharging, which can lead to thermal runaway or other hazardous conditions. Smart chargers are essential for managing the charge cycle, ensuring that the battery is charged within safe limits.

### **1.2 LiPo Charging Characteristics**

A typical single-cell LiPo battery has:
- **Nominal Voltage:** 3.7V
- **Fully Charged Voltage:** 4.2V

To safely charge a LiPo battery, the charger must handle two distinct phases:

1. **Constant Current (CC) Phase:**
   - The charger supplies a fixed current.
   - Continues until the battery voltage reaches 4.2V.

2. **Constant Voltage (CV) Phase:**
   - The charger maintains a constant voltage of 4.2V.
   - Gradually reduces the charging current as the battery approaches full charge.

Additionally, the charger must terminate the charging process to prevent overcharging. In this design, we utilize the **MCP73831** IC, a compact and efficient LiPo charging solution with built-in charge termination.
