# IMU Controlled Servo

To create a PCB design based on the wiring diagram shown in the image, which includes an Arduino Uno, two servos, and an MPU6050 (ITG/MPU module), I will provide a detailed guide on implementing the schematic into a PCB design using surface-mount components (SMD) and essential steps from a hardware designer's perspective.

## Components Identification:
1. **Arduino Uno**: We won't place an entire Arduino on the PCB. Instead, you will design around the ATmega328P (the microcontroller used on the Arduino Uno) and include essential external components like crystal oscillators, capacitors, and voltage regulators.
   
2. **Servos**: These can be connected via headers or connectors if you plan to use external servos. Ensure to use connectors that support the required current and voltage for your servo motors.

3. **MPU6050 (IMU)**: This IMU module will be replaced with the SMD version of the MPU6050, typically in a QFN package, along with pull-up resistors and necessary capacitors for stable operation.

## Step-by-Step Documentation to Implement the Schematic on PCB:

### 1. **Choose SMD Components**:
   - **ATmega328P**: Instead of using a large DIP package, choose the ATmega328P in the QFN package, which is much smaller and designed for PCB layouts.
   - **MPU6050**: Select the MPU6050 in the QFN package (often used in SMD designs). You will also need external components such as pull-up resistors for the I2C lines (SCL, SDA) and decoupling capacitors (typically 0.1µF) near the VCC and GND pins.
   - **Crystals and Capacitors**: Use an SMD crystal (16 MHz for the ATmega328P) and SMD ceramic capacitors (22pF typically) near the crystal.
   - **Voltage Regulator**: Use an SMD version of a 5V voltage regulator if your PCB will run on 12V or another voltage.

### 2. **Schematic Design in PCB Software**:
   - Open a PCB design software like KiCad or Eagle.
   - Begin by designing the schematic:
     1. **Microcontroller Section**: Add the ATmega328P and connect the crystal oscillator (16 MHz) with two capacitors (22pF) to the appropriate pins. Add decoupling capacitors (0.1µF) near the power pins (VCC and GND).
     2. **Power Section**: Add an SMD voltage regulator if needed (e.g., AMS1117-5.0 for 5V regulation). Place a 10µF input capacitor and a 10µF output capacitor (SMD electrolytic or ceramic capacitors).
     3. **Servo Connections**: Add headers or terminal blocks for the servos. Servos typically need 5V, so ensure the power and ground traces to these connectors are thick enough to handle the current.
     4. **MPU6050 Section**: Place the MPU6050 in your schematic, ensuring to include pull-up resistors (typically 4.7kΩ) on the SCL and SDA lines and a decoupling capacitor near VCC.
     5. **Connections to Peripherals**: Route the I2C lines (SCL and SDA) between the ATmega328P and the MPU6050. Make sure to label them properly.

### 3. **Designing the PCB Layout**:
   - After completing the schematic, move on to the PCB layout.
     1. **Place the Microcontroller**: Position the ATmega328P in the center for efficient routing. Place the crystal and capacitors close to the microcontroller for reduced signal noise.
     2. **Route Power Traces**: Use thicker traces (around 0.5mm or more) for the power (VCC and GND) traces to the servos and MPU6050.
     3. **Servo Connectors**: Place the servo connectors/headers on one edge of the board to make it easy to connect servos externally.
     4. **MPU6050 Placement**: Place the MPU6050 away from high-power traces to reduce interference, but keep it close enough to the microcontroller for efficient I2C communication.
     5. **Bypass Capacitors**: Ensure that decoupling capacitors are placed as close as possible to the power pins of both the ATmega328P and the MPU6050.
     6. **Ground Plane**: Use a solid ground plane on the bottom layer to minimize noise, especially important for sensors like the MPU6050.

### 4. **Power Considerations**:
   - Ensure that the power regulator you choose can provide sufficient current for both the microcontroller and the servos.
   - If your servos draw significant current, consider separating the power supply for the microcontroller and the servos using diodes or a separate voltage regulator.

### 5. **Testing and Debugging Provisions**:
   - Add test points on the important lines like I2C (SCL, SDA), power lines (VCC, GND), and important GPIOs for debugging purposes.
   - Consider adding a reset button and an ICSP header to program the ATmega328P using an external programmer.

### 6. **Final Design Steps**:
   - Once the layout is complete, run Design Rule Checks (DRC) in your PCB software to ensure there are no errors such as unconnected nets or trace width violations.
   - Export Gerber files, Bill of Materials (BoM), and a placement file for SMD assembly.

## Key Considerations:
- **Power Integrity**: Ensure that your power traces are sufficient to supply both the MPU6050 and the servos, as servos can draw significant current under load.
- **Noise Mitigation**: Keep analog signals like those from the MPU6050 away from high-current traces and digital PWM signals from the servos to prevent noise coupling.
- **Grounding**: Use a continuous ground plane to reduce the chances of signal noise affecting the MPU6050's readings.
