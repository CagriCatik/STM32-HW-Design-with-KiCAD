# Initial Component Placement and Layout

In this section, we will walk through the process of **importing component footprints** from the schematic into the PCB layout editor in KiCad. We will also cover the **initial rough placement** of components, focusing on grouping related components, optimizing placement for signal integrity, and setting up key elements like decoupling capacitors and crystal oscillators.

## **1. Importing Components into PCB Layout**

The first step in transitioning from the schematic to the PCB layout is to import the component footprints that were assigned during the schematic design phase.

### **Step 1: Update PCB from Schematic**
1. In the PCB Editor, click the **"Update PCB from Schematic"** button (icon of a wire connecting to a PCB).
2. This opens a dialog that lists all the components and their associated footprints. Ensure all components are included, then click **"Update PCB"**.
3. Once updated, close the dialog, and the component footprints will appear in a cluster on the PCB layout area.

### **Step 2: Initial Placement**
1. The imported footprints will be grouped together in the work area. You can move them to a more central location by selecting the group and pressing **M** to move them as a whole.
2. The next step is to organize these components into **logical groups**, such as:
   - **Microcontroller section** (including decoupling capacitors and oscillators).
   - **Power regulation section**.
   - **Connectors (USB, SWD, etc.)**.

## **2. Setting Up Initial Component Placement**

Once the components are imported, the next task is to place them on the PCB in a rough layout. This helps establish a general structure for the board and makes the routing process easier later on.

### **Step 1: Rough Layout of Components**
1. **Use a Larger Grid Size**: When arranging components initially, use a larger grid size (e.g., **1mm** or **0.5mm**) to quickly move components into place. You can fine-tune the positioning later with smaller grid sizes.
2. **Group Related Components**: Place components that are closely related (e.g., decoupling capacitors and the microcontroller) together to minimize trace lengths and ensure proper functioning.

### **Step 2: Visualizing the Layout in 3D**
1. Press **ALT + 3** or go to **View > 3D Viewer** to open the **3D view**. This gives you a visual representation of your board, showing how components are positioned in three dimensions.
2. If you notice missing elements like the **board outline**, don’t worry. We’ll define that after placing the components.

### **Step 3: Component Prioritization**
- Start by placing **critical components** such as decoupling capacitors, oscillators, and the microcontroller.
- Components like **connectors** (USB, power headers) and **power supplies** can be placed next.
- Leave less critical components like larger capacitors or indicator LEDs for last.

## **3. Placing Decoupling Capacitors**

**Decoupling capacitors** are essential for stabilizing the power supply and minimizing noise around the microcontroller. They should be placed as close as possible to their associated power pins on the microcontroller.

### **Step 1: Positioning Decoupling Capacitors**
1. In the schematic editor, locate the **decoupling capacitors** (e.g., **C4**, **C5**, etc.) associated with the **3.3V and GND** pins of the microcontroller.
2. In the PCB Editor, press **M** to move the decoupling capacitors close to the corresponding power pins on the microcontroller (e.g., **VCC** and **GND**).
   - Place them **within 2-3mm** of the pin to minimize the trace length, ensuring effective decoupling.

### **Step 2: Proper Orientation**
- Ensure the capacitors are oriented such that the **3.3V side** connects directly to the power pin and the **GND side** connects to ground with minimal trace length.
- Use **silkscreen adjustments** (move the silkscreen using **M**) to make the layout cleaner and ensure that the reference designators are clearly visible.

## **4. Placing the Crystal Oscillator**

The **crystal oscillator** provides the clock signal for the microcontroller and must be placed close to the oscillator input and output pins.

### **Step 1: Positioning the Crystal**
1. Find the **crystal oscillator** and its associated **load capacitors** in the PCB layout.
2. Place the crystal oscillator close to the **OSC_IN** and **OSC_OUT** pins of the microcontroller. Ensure that the trace lengths are as short as possible to reduce parasitic capacitance and maintain signal integrity.

### **Step 2: Load Capacitor Placement**
1. Place the **load capacitors** in line with the traces from the crystal oscillator to the microcontroller.
   - Positioning the capacitors in line with the traces ensures minimal added capacitance and reduces noise.
2. Keep the traces between the crystal, load capacitors, and microcontroller as short and direct as possible.

### **Step 3: Fine-Tuning Crystal Placement**
1. Rotate the crystal (**R** to rotate) if needed to align it with the microcontroller’s pins.
2. Use the **measurement tool** (**Ctrl + Shift + M**) to measure distances and ensure the components are spaced appropriately.
3. Leave space around the crystal and capacitors to avoid interference with other components and traces.

## **5. Moving and Grouping Power Supply Components**

The **power supply section** is another critical part of the PCB layout. It typically includes voltage regulators, input/output capacitors, and power filtering components like ferrite beads.

### **Step 1: Positioning the Voltage Regulator**
1. Place the **AMS1117-3.3V voltage regulator** near the **VBUS** input and route its **3.3V output** to the microcontroller’s power pins.
   - Ensure the regulator has enough space for proper heat dissipation.

### **Step 2: Positioning Decoupling and Bulk Capacitors**
1. Place the **input and output capacitors** close to the voltage regulator, ensuring proper decoupling and filtering of the power lines.
2. For bulk capacitors (e.g., **C8**, **C9**), you can place them a bit further away from the microcontroller but still in line with the power traces.

### **Step 3: Fine-Tuning the Power Layout**
1. Arrange the capacitors and ferrite beads (**if applicable**) in a neat and logical order. Make sure they are aligned with the power traces for minimal noise.
2. Check for spacing between components to ensure proper clearance during the routing stage.

## **6. Finalizing the Rough Layout**

Once you’ve placed the critical components, you can proceed with fine-tuning the placement of less critical parts and preparing for the routing stage.

### **Step 1: Check Component Spacing**
1. Ensure that there is enough spacing between components for proper routing and signal integrity.
   - For signal-critical components (such as USB differential pairs), plan for parallel trace routing with minimal crosstalk.
2. Use **ALT + 3** (3D Viewer) again to inspect the layout in 3D and ensure components aren’t too close to each other.

### **Step 2: Board Outline**
- The next step will involve **defining the board outline** and **adding mounting holes**. This is crucial for ensuring that the board fits into the intended enclosure and for securing it in place.

## **7. Conclusion**

You’ve now completed the initial **rough layout** of the PCB in KiCad, including the placement of critical components such as the microcontroller, decoupling capacitors, crystal oscillator, and power supply components. The next step involves refining the layout, defining the board outline, and preparing for **PCB routing**. This initial arrangement is essential for a clean, effective PCB design that ensures both manufacturability and performance.

In the next phase, you’ll fine-tune the layout, define the **board edges**, and start the **PCB routing** process, which involves connecting the electrical nets with copper traces.
