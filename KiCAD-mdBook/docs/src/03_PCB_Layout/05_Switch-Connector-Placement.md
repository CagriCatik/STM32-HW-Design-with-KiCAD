# Finalizing Rough Layout and Preparing for Power Circuitry

With the core components of our STM32-based PCB now placed, including the microcontroller, decoupling capacitors, and critical peripherals such as USB and SWD connectors, we can move on to **laying out the remaining parts** of the board. This phase focuses on fine-tuning the layout of connectors, passive components like resistors, and preparing for the **power supply circuitry**.

## **1. Laying Out the Remaining Components**

### **Step 1: Placing the Boot Zero Circuitry**
1. Start by positioning the **Boot Zero resistor** in series with the **Boot Zero switch**. This circuit allows you to toggle between boot modes of the microcontroller.
   - Use the **rat’s nest** to guide placement. The **Boot Zero** resistor should be placed in series with the switch and should be positioned near the **Boot Zero pin** on the microcontroller.
2. Move the switch to a position where it is easily accessible but does not interfere with other critical components.

### **Step 2: Positioning Connectors**
Next, focus on **fine-tuning the placement of connectors** (e.g., **UART, I²C**). Proper connector placement ensures that you can route traces efficiently while keeping assembly and testing in mind.

1. **Move the UART and I²C connectors** to the top or side edges of the PCB, making sure that their orientation is correct for easy routing and that power (3.3V and GND) connections align with other components.
   - Rotate the connectors using **R** to ensure the pins align correctly with other signal lines and components like resistors and pull-ups.
   - Place **power (3.3V) and ground pins** on the same sides of the connectors to simplify power distribution later during routing.
2. Ensure that the **silkscreen labels** do not overlap the copper pads, traces, or other components.

### **Step 3: Placing Passive Components**
1. Move passive components such as the **bypass capacitor** for the reset line (**C9**) and **pull-up resistors** for the I²C lines (**R4, R5**).
   - The **bypass capacitor** for the reset line should be placed near the **Reset** pin of the microcontroller, but this signal is not critical, so some distance is acceptable.
   - The **I²C pull-up resistors** should be positioned inline with the I²C signals (**SDA** and **SCL**). Place them close to the microcontroller pins or connectors to minimize trace length and interference.

### **Step 4: Fine-Tuning Power and Ground Traces**
1. When placing components like the UART or I²C connectors, ensure that the **3.3V and GND pins** are easily accessible for routing.
   - Adjust the orientation of resistors and other components so that **3.3V traces** can be routed easily between components without crossing traces unnecessarily.
   - Group **3.3V and ground connections** together to simplify power distribution.

## **2. Preparing for the Power Supply Circuitry**

The **power supply section** is critical for ensuring the stable operation of your microcontroller and peripherals. The layout for the power supply components should be planned to reduce noise and maintain efficiency.

### **Step 1: Placing the Voltage Regulator**
1. Start by positioning the **voltage regulator** (e.g., **AMS1117-3.3V**). This should be placed near the **VBUS** or **power input** connector but with enough space to dissipate heat.
   - Position the **input capacitors** (e.g., **C10**) and **output capacitors** (e.g., **C11**) close to the regulator to ensure stable power delivery.
2. Ensure that the **ground plane** is connected to the voltage regulator’s ground pin, with minimal trace length between the ground and the regulator.

### **Step 2: Arranging Input and Output Capacitors**
1. Place the **input capacitor** near the **VBUS** pin or power input to filter any noise on the incoming voltage.
   - The **output capacitor** should be placed near the **3.3V output pin** of the voltage regulator, ensuring smooth power to the microcontroller and peripherals.
2. Adjust the layout so that the **input and output capacitors** are inline with the power traces, minimizing the need for complicated routing later.

### **Step 3: Handling the Power Routing**
Since we are not using a dedicated power plane, it’s important to plan the power routing in a way that minimizes noise and interference.

1. Use **wide traces** (0.5mm or larger) for the **3.3V power lines** to handle current and reduce voltage drops.
2. Place vias for ground connections where needed, allowing power to flow smoothly between the top and bottom layers if necessary.
3. Ensure that **all power-sensitive components** (e.g., decoupling capacitors and pull-up resistors) are properly connected to the **3.3V supply** and **GND**.

## **3. Final Check for Component Placement**

### **Step 1: Inspect the Layout in 3D Viewer**
1. Open the **3D viewer** by pressing **ALT + 3** or navigating to **View > 3D Viewer**.
2. Inspect the layout to ensure that:
   - Components are properly aligned.
   - No parts are overlapping or colliding with other components.
   - The silkscreen labels are clear and readable, and they don’t overlap with pads or traces.

### **Step 2: Check for Assembly and Soldering Access**
1. Make sure that connectors, switches, and other components are placed in positions where they can be easily accessed during assembly.
   - Ensure there is **adequate spacing** between components for easy soldering, particularly for manual assembly.
   - Review whether components are too close to the edge of the board or to other parts that might make soldering difficult.

### **Step 3: Review Power Distribution**
1. Check that the **3.3V power lines** are well-distributed and positioned for easy routing.
   - Ensure that **ground connections** are spread out, reducing the chance of ground loops and ensuring a stable reference point for all components.

## **4. Conclusion**

At this stage, your rough layout should be complete, with all major components placed in their approximate final positions. Critical signals, such as **USB differential pairs** and **SWD connections**, have been laid out for easy routing, while connectors and resistors have been positioned to facilitate simple power routing and minimal trace crossings. The next step is to focus on routing the **power supply** and **signal traces** while ensuring that the design follows the electrical and manufacturing constraints.

By refining your rough layout in this manner, you’re setting yourself up for a clean, manufacturable PCB design that ensures both signal integrity and power stability. You’re now ready to begin the **routing phase**, where the final connections between components will be made, and the board will take its final form.
