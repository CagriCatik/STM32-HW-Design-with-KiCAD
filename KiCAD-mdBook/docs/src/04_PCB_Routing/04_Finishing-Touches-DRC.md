# Adding Final Touches: Silkscreen, Logos, and Design Rule Checks

As we finalize our PCB design, a few final steps remain to ensure the board is well-labeled, professional, and ready for manufacturing. These include adding **silkscreen annotations**, performing a **Design Rule Check (DRC)**, and possibly adding a **custom logo** or branding to the board. Here's how to proceed with these steps.

## **1. Adding Silkscreen Text and Labels**

The silkscreen layer provides text and graphics on the PCB that are printed on the board's surface. It’s essential for labeling connectors, switches, and components to ensure easier assembly, debugging, and future reference.

### **Step 1: Adding Silkscreen Text for Connectors and Components**
1. **Go to the Silkscreen Layer**: In KiCad, select the **Top Silkscreen layer** in the layer manager.
2. **Add Text**:
   - Select the **Add Text** tool, and type the relevant text (e.g., **SW1 Boot Select** or **UART**).
   - Position the text close to the corresponding connector or switch, ensuring it's easily readable and not overlapping with any other features.
3. **Adjust Font Size**:
   - A minimum font height of **1mm** is standard for readability.
   - Typically, I use **1.25mm** height with a stroke width of **0.2mm** to ensure the text is visible without being too bulky.

4. **Avoid Silkscreen on Pads and Vias**:
   - Double-check that your silkscreen does not overlap with any pads or vias. Silkscreen ink on solder pads can cause issues during assembly. You can move text away from holes by double-clicking the text and adjusting its position.

### **Step 2: Labeling Key Components**
- Add labels for **important connectors** such as **UART**, **SWD** (Serial Wire Debug), **power**, and **USB**, to indicate their function.
- Label any **switches** with their respective positions, e.g., **Bootloader Mode** or **Normal Operation** for a boot select switch.
- It’s also a good practice to add a revision number and board name (e.g., **Rev 1.0** or **Version 1**).

### **Step 3: Adding Silkscreen to the Bottom Side**
- If space permits, add information on the bottom side, such as the **board revision**, **project name**, or even a **manufacturer's name**. This helps identify the board in case of future revisions.
- You can also add **mounting hole locations** and reference designators like **R1**, **C2**, etc., for easy identification during assembly.

## **2. Running a Design Rule Check (DRC)**

Before sending your design off for manufacturing, it's essential to run a **Design Rule Check (DRC)** to catch any potential layout issues.

### **Step 1: Running the DRC in KiCad**
1. **Go to Tools > Design Rules Checker** in the top menu.
2. **Click 'Run DRC'**:
   - The DRC will check your PCB layout for violations such as **clearance issues**, **unrouted nets**, or **overlapping objects**.
   - It will also check if the design meets the **manufacturer’s specifications** (such as minimum track widths and via sizes).
3. **Review the Results**:
   - If the DRC finds **errors**, it will highlight them in red on your board, allowing you to quickly locate and correct any issues.
   - If there are no errors, you should see a **'0 Errors, 0 Warnings'** message, indicating your board is ready for production.

### **Step 2: Addressing DRC Warnings**
- **Unrouted Nets**: Ensure all signals are fully routed. Any **unconnected pins** should be marked with **no-connect (NC) flags**.
- **Clearance Violations**: If the DRC flags clearance issues (e.g., traces too close to each other or pads), adjust the routing or the component placement.

## **3. Adding a Custom Logo to the PCB**

Adding a logo to your PCB can make it more professional and is a nice touch for branding.

### **Step 1: Using KiCad’s Bitmap Image Converter**
1. **Go to the Image Converter Tool**:
   - In KiCad, open the **Bitmap2Component tool**. This tool allows you to convert an image (e.g., your logo) into a component footprint that can be placed on the silkscreen layer.
2. **Load Your Logo**:
   - Choose an image file (preferably a **monochrome bitmap**). Adjust the **size** in millimeters. If you have around **6mm** of space available on your PCB, you can scale the logo to fit within those dimensions.
3. **Generate the Logo**:
   - Choose **Front Silkscreen** as the target layer and **export** the logo as a footprint.
   - Return to the **PCB Layout Editor**, and place the logo in an appropriate position.

### **Step 2: Positioning the Logo**
- Place the logo in a **free space** on the PCB, preferably away from critical areas like connectors or mounting holes.
- Use the **3D viewer** (`ALT + 3`) to ensure the logo is correctly placed and not overlapping any important features.

## **4. Finalizing the Board: Naming and Revisioning**

Before generating the final manufacturing files, it's good practice to:
- **Add the board’s name** and **revision** to the silkscreen layer.
- You can also add the **date** of the revision or a short URL for project documentation.

## **5. Preparing Manufacturing Files: Gerbers and Drill Files**

Once your board design is complete, and the DRC shows no errors, the final step is to generate the files needed by the manufacturer:
1. **Gerber Files**: These files contain the data for each layer of the PCB (e.g., copper layers, solder mask, silkscreen).
   - Go to **File > Plot** and select the layers you want to export (e.g., **F.Cu**, **B.Cu**, **F.SilkS**).
   - Click **Plot** to generate the **Gerber files**.

2. **Drill Files**: These files contain the information about the holes that need to be drilled (e.g., for vias or through-hole components).
   - In the **Plot window**, click **Generate Drill Files** and export them.

3. **Review the Gerbers**: Use a **Gerber viewer** to inspect the generated files and ensure they match your intended design.

## **Conclusion: Final Touches for a Professional PCB**

By following these steps—adding informative silkscreen labels, performing a DRC, and including a logo—you can ensure your PCB design is well-prepared for manufacturing. The next step is to submit your **Gerber** and **drill files** to your PCB manufacturer for production.

With these final touches, your design is complete, professional, and ready for fabrication!
