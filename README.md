This project documents my first complete PCB design journey using KiCad and an STM32 microcontroller. It represents a hands-on, end-to-end dive into schematic design, PCB layout, routing, manufacturing files, and the practical considerations required to make a real, manufacturable embedded board.

The goal was not only to learn KiCad as a professional tool, but to understand what makes a microcontroller board electrically reliable, layout-aware, and production-ready. Every stage reflects actual engineering constraints encountered during the design of a small STM32-based board.
