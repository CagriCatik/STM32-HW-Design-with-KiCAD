This schematic shows a typical **I2C bus** configuration with pull-up resistors for the **SCL (clock)** and **SDA (data)** lines, which are necessary for the proper operation of the I2C communication protocol. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the circuit:

### Purpose:
In I2C communication, the **SCL (Serial Clock Line)** and **SDA (Serial Data Line)** are open-drain (or open-collector) lines. This means that the devices on the bus can only pull the lines low, and external pull-up resistors are required to pull them high when no device is driving the lines. The resistors shown (R10 and R11) serve this purpose.

### Explanation:

1. **Resistors (R10 - 2.2kΩ, R11 - 2.2kΩ):**
   - These are **pull-up resistors** connected between the **SCL (R10)** and **SDA (R11)** lines and the 3.3V power supply.
   - The pull-up resistors ensure that when no device on the I2C bus is pulling the line low, the lines will be pulled up to a logic high level (3.3V in this case).
   - The value of the resistors (2.2kΩ) is a commonly chosen value for I2C lines, providing a balance between power consumption and bus speed. Lower resistor values lead to faster rise times (better for higher-speed I2C), while higher values consume less power but may slow down the bus.

2. **I2C1_SCL and I2C1_SDA:**
   - These are the **clock (SCL)** and **data (SDA)** lines of the I2C bus, labeled as "I2C1" to indicate that they are for the first I2C bus of the microcontroller or IC.
   - The SCL line is used to synchronize data transfer, and the SDA line is used for bi-directional data communication between devices on the bus.
   - Both lines need to be pulled up to 3.3V (as shown by the pull-up resistors) to function properly.

3. **+3.3V Power Rail:**
   - The 3.3V power rail supplies the necessary voltage to pull the SCL and SDA lines high when no device on the bus is pulling them low.
   - This ensures that the communication between the I2C master and slave devices can reliably use logic levels of 0 (GND) and 1 (3.3V).

### Functionality:
- The I2C bus is designed for communication between multiple devices, typically one master (such as a microcontroller) and multiple slave devices (sensors, EEPROMs, etc.).
- The pull-up resistors are essential for the open-drain/open-collector nature of the I2C lines. Without them, the lines would not return to a logic high state, and communication would fail.

### Resistor Value Choice:
- The typical range for I2C pull-up resistors is between **1kΩ and 10kΩ**, depending on the bus speed and the capacitance of the lines. 
- The 2.2kΩ resistors used here are a good compromise for general-purpose I2C applications, providing sufficient pull-up strength for typical I2C bus speeds (100 kHz or 400 kHz).

### Application:
- This pull-up resistor configuration is common in I2C communication circuits for connecting sensors, displays, or memory devices to a microcontroller.
- The I2C protocol is often used in embedded systems because it requires only two communication lines and supports multiple devices on the same bus.

### Summary:
This schematic shows the typical **pull-up resistor configuration for an I2C bus**. The **SCL (clock)** and **SDA (data)** lines are connected to the 3.3V power supply via pull-up resistors (2.2kΩ each). These resistors ensure that the I2C lines return to a high logic level when not actively driven low by devices on the bus. This configuration is essential for the correct operation of the I2C protocol in digital communication systems.
