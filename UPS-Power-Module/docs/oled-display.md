# OLED Display

This schematic shows a display module using the **SSD1306** driver, which is commonly used for controlling small OLED displays. The display in this design has an **active area of 0.91 inches** and a resolution of **128x32 pixels**. The SSD1306 operates using an **I2C interface**, making it suitable for connecting to microcontrollers or other systems with limited pin availability. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their purposes:

### Main Display Module (U13 - M96-16-SSD1306):
- **SSD1306 Driver**: This IC is responsible for driving the OLED display. It receives commands and data from a microcontroller over the I2C bus and translates them into signals to control the OLED pixels.
- **C2P, C2N, C1P, C1N (Pins 1-4)**: These are pins related to internal charge pump circuits for generating the necessary voltage to drive the OLED display. They are connected to capacitors (**C31 and C32**) to stabilize the internal voltages.
- **VBAT (Pin 6)**: Battery voltage input for the OLED power supply. In this case, it is connected to **3.3V**.
- **VBREF (Pin 7)**: Voltage reference input, also tied to 3.3V.
- **VDD, VSS (Pins 8, 9)**: Supply voltage and ground connections for the logic side of the display (3.3V).
- **RES (Pin 10)**: Reset pin, used to reset the SSD1306 driver when needed.
- **SCL, SDA (Pins 11, 12)**: These are the I2C clock (SCL) and data (SDA) lines, used for communication between the display and the microcontroller.
- **IREF (Pin 13)**: Current reference pin. A resistor (R33) sets the reference current for the internal operations of the display.
- **VCOMH (Pin 14)**: Common voltage reference pin, stabilized by a capacitor (C34).

### Supporting Components:
- **Capacitors (C31, C32, C36, C37, C38)**: These capacitors provide filtering and stabilization for the internal power and charge pump circuits. For example:
  - **C31 and C32 (1µF)**: Used for the charge pump.
  - **C36 and C37 (4.7µF)**: Used for stabilizing the supply voltage and minimizing ripple.
  - **C38 (4.7µF)**: Provides additional filtering for the 3.3V rail.
- **Resistors (R31, R32, R33, R34)**:
  - **R31, R32 (4.7kΩ)**: Pull-up resistors for the I2C bus lines (SDA and SCL). These are standard in I2C circuits to ensure proper high logic levels on the bus.
  - **R33 (560kΩ)**: Sets the reference current for the IREF pin of the SSD1306.
  - **R34 (4.7kΩ)**: Another pull-up resistor for the RES pin, ensuring the reset line stays high unless actively pulled low by the system.
  
- **D1 (IN4148 Diode)**: This diode provides protection to the circuit by ensuring proper voltage clamping and blocking reverse currents.

### I2C Interface (Header1):
- **SDA and SCL Pins**: These are the communication lines that connect the display to the microcontroller or processor. They are used for sending data and commands to the display.
- **3V3**: The power supply voltage provided to the display and supporting components.
- **5V**: Not directly connected to the display, but provided for compatibility with other peripherals.
- **GND**: The common ground for all the components.

### General Purpose of the Circuit:
This circuit is a typical configuration for an **OLED display driven by the SSD1306** using the **I2C communication protocol**. The display module is powered by a **3.3V supply**, and all necessary pull-up resistors, capacitors, and protection diodes are included to ensure proper functionality. The **I2C bus** allows this display to be easily integrated into a variety of systems, including microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any other I2C-enabled device.

The **main purpose** of this circuit is to drive a small OLED display and allow a system (likely a microcontroller) to interface with it via I2C to display text, images, or graphics on the 128x32 pixel screen.
