# First Steps in PCB Design

This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first PCB design step by step using KiCad version 6. Whether you're new to hardware design or an experienced engineer, this document will provide detailed instructions on how to navigate the software, create your first schematic, and design a PCB for your STM32-based project.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to confidently use KiCad to create and finalize your PCB designs. This guide complements your course on STM32 hardware design and focuses on utilizing KiCad as the primary tool.

## **1. Launch KiCad and Create a New Project**

Before you can start designing your PCB, the first step is to set up a new project in KiCad.

### **Steps**:
1. **Open KiCad**:
   - Once the installation is complete, launch the KiCad application.
  
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Navigate to **File > New Project** from the top menu.
   - Choose a location where you want to store your project files.
   - Provide a **name** for your project (e.g., `STM32_First_Project`).
   - Select **Create** to set up your project.

   > **Tip**: KiCad automatically creates two files for your project: a `.pro` file (the project file) and a `.sch` file (the schematic file). It’s important to maintain these files and folders organized as your design complexity increases.

## **2. Drawing the Schematic**

The next step in your PCB design process is to create the schematic, which defines how the components of your circuit are connected.

### **Steps to Draw the Schematic**:
1. **Open the Schematic Editor**:
   - In the project window, click on the **Schematic Editor** icon to start working on your circuit design.

2. **Add Components**:
   - To add components like the STM32 microcontroller, click on the **Place Symbol** tool (shortcut key: `A`).
   - A component library window will open. Search for components such as "STM32" or "resistors" and place them onto the schematic.
   
   > **Tip**: If a component is not in the default library, you may need to install a specific library or create custom symbols for unique components.

3. **Connect Components**:
   - Use the **Wire** tool (shortcut key: `W`) to connect the components in your schematic.
   - Click from one pin to another to create the necessary electrical connections.

4. **Add Power and Ground Symbols**:
   - Add power (`VCC`) and ground (`GND`) symbols to your schematic to complete the circuit. These can be found in the symbol library under **Power Ports**.

5. **Annotate the Schematic**:
   - Before moving to the layout, you need to assign unique identifiers to each component. Go to **Tools > Annotate Schematic**, and KiCad will automatically label each part (e.g., `R1`, `U1`, `C1`).

6. **Perform Electrical Rule Check (ERC)**:
   - Use the **Electrical Rules Check** tool to identify any connectivity issues in your schematic. This helps ensure that all components are properly connected.

## **3. Assigning Footprints to Components**

Each symbol in your schematic corresponds to a physical component on the PCB. The next step is to assign appropriate footprints (i.e., the physical dimensions of components) to each symbol.

### **Steps to Assign Footprints**:
1. **Open the Footprint Assignment Tool**:
   - Go to **Tools > Assign Footprints** from the schematic editor.
   
2. **Select Footprints**:
   - For each component (e.g., resistors, capacitors, microcontroller), choose the appropriate footprint from the KiCad libraries. For example, for the STM32 microcontroller, choose a footprint that matches the specific package type (e.g., `LQFP48`).

3. **Confirm Footprint Assignments**:
   - Once all components have footprints, confirm your selections and return to the schematic editor.

## **4. Generating the Netlist**

The netlist is a file that defines all the electrical connections in your circuit. It will be used in the PCB layout process to route the connections between components.

### **Steps to Generate the Netlist**:
1. **Generate Netlist**:
   - In the schematic editor, go to **Tools > Generate Netlist**.
   - Save the netlist in your project folder.

## **5. PCB Layout and Routing**

With the schematic complete, it's time to move on to the PCB layout. This is where you'll define the physical placement of components and route the electrical connections.

### **Steps to Start PCB Layout**:
1. **Open the PCB Layout Editor**:
   - In the project window, click the **PCB Editor** icon to start designing the PCB.

2. **Import the Netlist**:
   - Import the netlist into the PCB editor by going to **Tools > Update PCB from Schematic**. This will load all the components and their connections into the layout.

3. **Place Components**:
   - Drag and place the components onto the PCB. Try to place components in a logical manner to minimize the length of traces (e.g., keep decoupling capacitors close to power pins).
   
   > **Tip**: Make sure to consider signal integrity when placing components, especially for high-speed signals like clocks.

4. **Route Traces**:
   - Use the **Route Tracks** tool (shortcut: `X`) to manually route the connections between components. Start with critical traces (like power and ground) and ensure appropriate routing for high-speed signals.
   - You can also use the **Fill Zones** tool to create ground planes, which improve the stability of your design.

5. **Run Design Rule Check (DRC)**:
   - Use the **Design Rules Check** tool to verify that the layout complies with your design rules (e.g., trace width, clearance between traces, etc.).

## **6. Finalizing the Design and Generating Manufacturing Files**

Once the layout is complete and the design passes all checks, you can generate the files needed to get the PCB manufactured.

### **Steps to Generate Gerber Files**:
1. **Generate Gerber Files**:
   - In the PCB Editor, go to **File > Plot**.
   - Select **Gerber** as the file format and configure the layers to be included (e.g., top layer, bottom layer, silkscreen, etc.).

2. **Generate Drill Files**:
   - After generating the Gerber files, go to **File > Generate Drill Files**. This will create files for the holes that need to be drilled in the PCB.

3. **Bill of Materials (BOM)**:
   - Go to **Tools > Generate BOM** to create a bill of materials listing all the components used in the design.

4. **Send to Manufacturer**:
   - The Gerber and drill files can be sent to a PCB manufacturer (e.g., JLCPCB) for fabrication.

## **7. Programming the STM32 Microcontroller**

Once your PCB is manufactured and assembled, you’ll need to program the STM32 microcontroller.

### **Steps to Program STM32**:
1. **STM32CubeMX or Arduino IDE**:
   - Depending on your preference, you can use **STM32CubeMX** or the **Arduino IDE** to write firmware for your STM32 board.

2. **Flashing the Firmware**:
   - Use a programmer (e.g., ST-Link) to upload the firmware to the STM32 microcontroller.
