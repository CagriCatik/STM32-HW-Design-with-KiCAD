# STM32 Microcontroller and Decoupling

This guide provides an in-depth explanation of the STM32 PCB design process using KiCad, focusing on best practices and essential design principles. We will walk through the creation of a schematic, configuring microcontroller connections, and proper power management, emphasizing the critical role of decoupling capacitors and filtering for analog and digital circuits.

## **1. Getting Started with KiCad**

The first step in any PCB design is creating the schematic, or what is commonly referred to as "schematic capture." KiCad provides a robust schematic editor that allows you to lay out your design before creating the PCB layout.

### **Opening the Schematic Editor**
- From the KiCad project window, click on **Schematic Editor**.
- You will be presented with a blank schematic canvas. Use the **middle mouse button** to move around the canvas and scroll in and out to zoom.
- Toolbars are available at the top and right of the interface. We’ll primarily use the toolbar on the right for component placement.

## **2. Placing Components (Symbols) on the Schematic**

Components in KiCad are represented by symbols. These symbols are placed on the schematic and connected to each other to form the circuit.

### **STM32 Microcontroller**
- In this tutorial, we are designing a PCB based on the STM32F103 series microcontroller (MCU).
- Click on **Add Symbol** on the right toolbar. This opens the symbol library where you can search for components.
- Search for the STM32F103 microcontroller and select the variant that matches your design requirements. For example, you can use STM32F103C8T6, a common microcontroller for blue pill boards.
- Once selected, place it in the center of your schematic.
- **Note**: The STM32 microcontroller comes in various packages, and their features (RAM, Flash, pins) can vary, so ensure that the selected part fits your design.

### **Understanding STM32 Pinout**
STM32 microcontrollers are divided into different pin banks for various functions:
- **Power Pins**: VDD (main power) and VBAT (battery backup for RTC).
- **Ground Pins**: VSS and VSSA (for analog circuits).
- **GPIO Pins**: Organized into banks (PAx, PBx, etc.).
- **Configuration Pins**: These include reset, boot, and other control pins.

## **3. Configuring Power and Ground Connections**

Proper power and ground routing is essential to ensure stable operation, especially for sensitive microcontroller circuits.

### **Adding Ground (GND)**
- To add a ground symbol, click on **Add Power Port** from the toolbar and choose the GND symbol from the library.
- Place the GND symbol near the microcontroller.
- To clean up the schematic, you can hide unnecessary labels for common grounds (use the **E** key to edit, then check **Hide Value**).

### **Connecting Ground Pins**
- To connect ground pins (VSS, VSSA) on the STM32 to the GND symbol, hover over the pin and press **W** to wire the connection. Repeat this for all ground pins.
- In most designs, digital and analog grounds are tied together unless a specific design requires separation for noise isolation.

### **Adding Power (VDD)**
- Add the **+3.3V** power symbol using the **Add Power Port** tool.
- Place it next to the VDD pin of the microcontroller and connect using the wiring tool (**W**).
- If the design uses VBAT for the real-time clock (RTC) feature, connect it to the same 3.3V rail if no external battery is present.

## **4. Decoupling Capacitors**

Decoupling capacitors are critical for ensuring smooth power delivery to the microcontroller. They mitigate noise and provide local energy storage for fast current transitions.

### **Placing Decoupling Capacitors**
- Typically, you need one **100nF (0.1µF)** decoupling capacitor for each VDD and VBAT pin.
- Add capacitors by clicking **Add Symbol** and searching for a generic capacitor. Place them close to each power pin.
- Connect one end of the capacitor to the power rail (VDD) and the other to ground (GND).

### **Bulk Decoupling**
In addition to the small capacitors, a **bulk decoupling capacitor** (e.g., 10µF) should be placed near the microcontroller to handle larger current fluctuations.
- Place this capacitor between VDD and GND as well.

## **5. Filtering for Analog Power**

Analog circuits are typically more sensitive to noise, so additional filtering is required for the analog supply (VDA). STM32 microcontrollers often require filtering components such as capacitors and ferrite beads.

### **Designing the Filter**
- Use a combination of a **10nF capacitor** and a **1µF capacitor** in parallel to filter the analog power supply.
- Place a **ferrite bead** between the main 3.3V rail and the filtered 3.3V (denoted as **+3.3VA** for analog).
- The ferrite bead should have a resistance of approximately **120 ohms** at 100 MHz, which helps attenuate high-frequency noise.

### **Connecting Analog Power**
- Connect the filtered 3.3VA rail to the VDA pin of the STM32.
- The ground pin for the analog section (VSSA) should be tied to the main ground (GND).

## **6. Reset and Boot Configuration**

The STM32 requires additional configuration pins to ensure proper startup behavior. Two important pins are:
- **NRST**: The reset pin, which is typically connected to a reset button or an external circuit for manual resets.
- **BOOT0/BOOT1**: Pins used to configure the boot mode of the microcontroller.

### **Connecting Reset Circuit**
- Add a pull-up resistor (typically **10kΩ**) to the NRST pin, connecting it to the 3.3V supply.
- Optionally, connect a reset button between NRST and GND to allow manual resets.

### **Boot Mode Selection**
- Add resistors to the **BOOT0** and **BOOT1** pins to configure the startup mode. For most applications, connecting BOOT0 to GND ensures the microcontroller boots from Flash memory.

## **7. Power Regulation**

If your design requires an external power source (e.g., a 5V input), a voltage regulator is necessary to step it down to 3.3V for the STM32.

### **Adding a Voltage Regulator**
- Place a **3.3V linear regulator** such as the **AMS1117-3.3** on the schematic.
- Connect the input to your power source (e.g., 5V) and the output to the 3.3V power rail.
- Add decoupling capacitors to both the input and output of the regulator (typically 10µF for stability).

## **8. Finalizing the Schematic**

Before proceeding to PCB layout, review the schematic for missing connections or components:
- Ensure all power and ground connections are complete.
- Verify decoupling capacitors are placed close to the microcontroller pins.
- Check the boot and reset circuits for proper configuration.
