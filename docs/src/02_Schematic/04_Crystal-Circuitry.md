## 5. Calculating the Load Capacitor Values

Accurate calculation of load capacitors is essential for ensuring the crystal oscillates at the desired frequency.

### Load Capacitor Calculation Formula

\[
C_{load} = \frac{C_{crystal} - C_{stray}}{2}
\]

- **C_crystal:** Load capacitance specified in the crystal's datasheet (typically **10-20 pF**).
- **C_stray:** Estimated stray capacitance from the PCB (typically **3-5 pF**).

### Example Calculation

**Given:**
- **Crystal Load Capacitance (C_crystal):** 10 pF
- **Stray Capacitance (C_stray):** 5 pF

**Calculation:**

\[
C_{load} = \frac{10 \, \text{pF} - 5 \, \text{pF}}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{pF}
\]

**Implementation:**
- Use **two 2.5 pF capacitors** connected from each crystal pin to ground.
- Alternatively, if 2.5 pF capacitors are not readily available, use the nearest standard value (e.g., 3 pF) and adjust as necessary.

### Steps in KiCad to Add Load Capacitors

1. **Add Capacitors:**
   - Select **Add Symbol** and search for **"capacitor"**.

2. **Choose Appropriate Capacitors:**

3. **Place Capacitors on the Schematic:**
   - Position one capacitor connected to **HSE_IN**.
   - Position the second capacitor connected to **HSE_OUT**.

4. **Connect to Ground:**
   - Ensure the other ends of both capacitors are connected to **GND**.

### Crystal Circuit Without Feedback Resistor

  - Omit the feedback resistor unless specific conditions necessitate its inclusion.
  
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduced component count.
  - Simplified routing and potentially lower cost.

- **Verification:**
  - Consult **AN2867** to confirm that omitting the feedback resistor is suitable for your specific application.
