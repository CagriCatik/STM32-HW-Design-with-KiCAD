#Connecting USB Circuitry to STM32 in KiCad

This section will guide you through the process of integrating USB circuitry into your STM32 microcontroller design using KiCad. We will cover how to add a USB connector, configure the USB differential pair, handle power (VBUS), and ensure proper detection as a USB 2.0 full-speed device with the necessary resistors. Following these steps ensures that your design complies with USB standards and works reliably in practice.

## **1. Adding a USB Connector to the Schematic**

In this example, we are using a **USB Micro** connector, which is commonly used for device-only applications, though the process is similar for USB-C. The steps below outline how to add the USB connector and wire it to the STM32 microcontroller.

### **Step 1: Select the USB Connector Symbol**
1. Click on **Add Symbol** in KiCad.
2. Search for **USB** in the symbol library.
3. Select a **USB Micro** connector symbol and place it near the USB pins of the STM32 microcontroller.

### **USB Pinouts for Device-Only Operation**
- **V_BUS**: The USB power pin (usually 5V) that supplies power to the device.
- **GND**: Ground connection shared between the USB and the microcontroller.
- **D+ (USB_DP)**: Positive data line (part of the differential pair).
- **D- (USB_DM)**: Negative data line (part of the differential pair).
- **ID**: Identification pin used for USB On-The-Go (OTG), but can be ignored for device-only applications.
- **Shield**: Connects to the outer casing of the USB connector but often left floating in device-only designs.

### **Step 2: Connect USB Differential Pair**
1. Use the **Wiring Tool (W)** to connect the **D+** and **D-** pins of the STM32 to the **D+ (USB_DP)** and **D- (USB_DM)** pins of the USB connector.
2. Ensure that the differential pair is routed properly and named appropriately, using net labels like **USB_DP** and **USB_DM**.

### **Step 3: Connect Power and Ground**
1. **V_BUS**: This pin will provide the power (typically 5V) from the USB host. Label the net **VBUS**.
2. **GND**: Connect the USB ground pin to the main ground (GND) of the circuit.

### **Step 4: Handling the Shield and ID Pins**
- **Shield**: In device-only designs, it is common to leave the shield floating to prevent ground loops. You can place a **Do Not Connect (DNC)** flag by selecting the pin and pressing **Q** to ensure it is marked properly.
- **ID Pin**: The ID pin is used in USB OTG (On-The-Go) to switch between host and device modes. In device-only designs, you should also mark this pin as **DNC**.

## **2. Adding the Power Circuit (VBUS)**

The USB VBUS pin supplies the 5V power to the device. However, since the STM32 microcontroller operates at 3.3V, you will need to integrate a voltage regulator to step down the voltage.

### **Step 1: Label VBUS**
- Use the **Power Port Tool** to label the VBUS pin in the schematic. This pin will feed the voltage regulator, which provides 3.3V to the microcontroller.

### **Step 2: Voltage Regulation**
- You will use a **voltage regulator** (e.g., AMS1117-3.3V) to step down the 5V from VBUS to 3.3V for the STM32.
- Ensure the regulator is placed near the USB connector in the schematic. The **input** of the regulator connects to **VBUS**, and the **output** connects to the 3.3V power rail of the STM32.

### **Power Regulation Recap**:
- **VBUS** (5V) → **Voltage Regulator** → **3.3V** for STM32.

## **3. Ensuring Proper USB Detection (1.5K Resistor on D+ Line)**

In USB 2.0 full-speed devices, the **D+ line** (USB_DP) must be pulled up to a voltage between 3.0V and 3.6V via a **1.5KΩ resistor**. This pull-up resistor signals to the host that the device is ready for communication.

### **Step 1: Place the 1.5KΩ Resistor**
1. Click **Add Symbol** and search for a **resistor**.
2. Place the resistor between the **D+ (USB_DP)** line and the 3.3V power rail.
3. Label the resistor value as **1K5** (which is the convention for labeling a 1.5KΩ resistor).

### **Step 2: Connect the Resistor**
1. One terminal of the resistor is connected to **USB_DP**.
2. The other terminal is connected to **3.3V**.

This resistor is critical for ensuring that the USB device is detected by the host as a **USB 2.0 full-speed device**. Without this resistor, the device would not be recognized by the host.

### **Recap**:
- A **1.5KΩ resistor** is required between the **D+ line** and **3.3V** to signal USB 2.0 full-speed compliance.

## **4. Electrical Rule Check (ERC)**

Once your USB circuitry is connected, it is important to run an **Electrical Rule Check (ERC)** in KiCad to ensure there are no schematic issues that could lead to malfunctions.

### **Step 1: Add Do Not Connect (DNC) Flags**
- Ensure that you’ve added **DNC flags** to the **Shield** and **ID** pins on the USB connector to prevent ERC errors. These pins are not connected in device-only applications but need to be flagged to avoid warnings.

### **Step 2: Run ERC**
- Go to **Tools > Electrical Rules Checker** and run the check. Ensure that no errors appear, especially related to the USB connections. The presence of the **1.5KΩ pull-up resistor** on the **D+ line** should ensure proper functionality and compliance with USB 2.0 specifications.

## **5. Application Notes and Best Practices**

### **Reference Documents**
1. **AN4879: USB Hardware and PCB Guidelines for STM32 Microcontrollers**: This document provides detailed guidance on the USB circuitry for STM32 microcontrollers. It explains the need for pull-up resistors and offers insight into PCB routing for optimal performance.
2. **AN2867: Oscillator Design for STM32**: This document includes information on external clock sources, which may be relevant if your design uses a crystal oscillator alongside USB.

### **Termination and Resistors**
- As outlined in **AN4879**, certain STM32 microcontroller series (such as the F1 and F3 series) require a **1.5KΩ pull-up resistor** on the D+ line to ensure the USB is detected as a full-speed device.
- In contrast, higher-end STM32 devices may have internal pull-ups, making external resistors unnecessary. Always refer to the microcontroller’s specific datasheet and application notes to confirm the requirements for your device.

## **6. Finalizing the USB Circuit in the Schematic**

At this stage, your USB circuit should be fully configured and ready for use. To recap:
1. **USB Connector**: A USB Micro or USB-C connector is connected to the USB pins (D+ and D-) on the STM32.
2. **VBUS**: The USB power supply (5V) is connected to a voltage regulator that steps down to 3.3V for the microcontroller.
3. **1.5KΩ Resistor**: A pull-up resistor is placed on the D+ line to signal USB full-speed mode.
4. **Grounding**: Proper grounding is ensured, and the shield and ID pins are marked as **DNC**.
