# Python Scripting in KiCad

Python scripting in KiCad offers an expansive framework for automating tasks, enhancing workflow efficiency, and extending the software's capabilities to meet specific design requirements. Leveraging Python within KiCad can transform the PCB design process, enabling more advanced control over every stage, from schematic capture to final layout and manufacturing outputs.

This documentation provides an in-depth look into Python scripting in KiCad, including concepts, best practices, and detailed use cases. It targets intermediate and advanced PCB designers looking to optimize their workflow through scripting automation.

## Key Applications of Python Scripting in KiCad

### 1. **Automated PCB Design Tasks**
Python scripts can automate repetitive design tasks, such as component placement, netlist generation, and running design rule checks (DRC). This speeds up the design process while reducing human error.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Automatically place components based on a predefined layout pattern.
- Run design rule checks across multiple boards, ensuring consistency across designs.
- Automate tasks such as routing traces between pins or components with specific spacing rules.

### 2. **Customized Footprint Generation**
Python scripting allows users to create custom footprints for components. This is useful for generating non-standard footprints or when dealing with a large number of components that need consistent pad layouts and silkscreen markings.

**Best Practice:**
When generating footprints programmatically, ensure that all dimensions (e.g., pad sizes and spacings) are based on the component's datasheet. This avoids alignment or sizing issues in PCB layout.

### 3. **Design Rule Checking (DRC) Customization**
DRC rules in KiCad can be extended using Python. You can enforce custom constraints that may not be covered by KiCad’s default checks. This ensures your design adheres to your specific project or manufacturing requirements.

**Example:**
- Enforce a rule where specific components need additional clearance from high-voltage traces.
- Check for specific routing constraints around sensitive analog or RF sections.

### 4. **Netlist Manipulation**
Scripts can manipulate the netlist to merge or filter certain signals, analyze the connectivity of components, or reassign pins for optimization.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Combine netlists from hierarchical designs.
- Analyze nets for redundant connections or shorts.
- Automatically adjust netlists for alternative routing strategies.

### 5. **Bill of Materials (BOM) Generation**
Python scripts can generate BOMs based on the design, including custom fields such as part numbers, supplier information, and quantities. This streamlines the procurement process and simplifies sourcing components.

**Best Practice:**
Generate a detailed BOM that includes manufacturer part numbers and supplier details. Use scripts to ensure that the BOM format matches the requirements of your assembly house or procurement system.

### 6. **Scripting Plugins**
KiCad supports custom plugins written in Python, enabling the creation of tools that extend the software’s functionality. These plugins can be used for specialized tasks such as:
- Automating specific layout optimizations.
- Integrating with external tools (e.g., simulation software, mechanical CAD tools).
- Adding new analysis or verification tools tailored to your workflow.

### 7. **Integration with External Tools**
Python scripts in KiCad can interface with external software, databases, or simulation tools. This capability allows for powerful integrations, such as:
- Importing/exporting data to mechanical CAD software.
- Interfacing with version control systems to track design changes.
- Running electrical simulations using data from the PCB layout.

### 8. **User Interface Customization**
With Python scripting, you can add new menus, dialog boxes, and shortcuts to KiCad’s interface, providing a more tailored user experience.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Add a custom menu for running specific design tasks.
- Automate frequently used workflows, such as exporting Gerber files or updating footprints.

### 9. **Design Automation**
Scripts can be used to automate the entire design process, from schematic capture to PCB layout and validation. This is particularly useful for:
- Batch processing multiple designs.
- Iteratively optimizing a design for performance or manufacturability.
- Automatically generating design documentation.

### 10. **Community Contributions**
The KiCad community has developed a wealth of Python scripts and plugins. By leveraging these resources, you can extend KiCad’s functionality even further and tap into the expertise of others.

**Best Practice:**
Before writing your script, explore existing community tools that may already solve your problem. Contributing back to the community with your custom scripts ensures that others can benefit from your work.

## Practical Example: Generating a Custom Footprint with Python

This example demonstrates how Python can be used in KiCad to generate a custom footprint for a component with specific design requirements.

### Script: Custom Footprint Generation
```python
import pcbnew

def generate_custom_footprint(component_name):
    # Create a new footprint object
    footprint = pcbnew.Footprint()

    # Set footprint properties
    footprint.SetReference(component_name)
    footprint.SetDescription("Custom footprint for " + component_name)

    # Define pad layout and dimensions
    pad_count = 4
    pad_width = 1.0  # in mm
    pad_height = 1.0  # in mm
    pad_spacing = 1.5  # in mm

    # Add pads to the footprint
    for i in range(pad_count):
        pad = pcbnew.D_PAD(footprint)
        pad.SetSize(pcbnew.wxSizeMM(pad_width, pad_height))
        pad.SetPosition(pcbnew.wxPointMM(i * pad_spacing, 0))  # Adjust position for each pad
        footprint.Add(pad)

    # Save the footprint to a file
    footprint_file_path = component_name + ".kicad_mod"
    pcbnew.PCB_IO().FootprintSave(footprint, footprint_file_path)

    print("Custom footprint generated for", component_name)

# Example usage
generate_custom_footprint("CustomComponent")
```

### How it Works:
1. **Footprint Creation**: A new footprint object is created, and basic properties like the reference and description are set.
2. **Pad Layout**: The script defines a 4-pad layout, where each pad has a specified size and spacing.
3. **Saving the Footprint**: The footprint is saved as a `.kicad_mod` file, which can then be imported into a KiCad project.

### Using the Script:
1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `generate_footprint.py`.
2. Open KiCad’s scripting console and execute the script:

```python
execfile("/path/to/generate_footprint.py")
```

The footprint will be generated and saved in the `.kicad_mod` format for use in your project.

## Best Practices for Python Scripting in KiCad

1. **Modularity**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable scripts or functions. This improves readability and maintainability of your code.
2. **Testing and Validation**: After automating tasks with scripts, validate the output rigorously. For example, after generating a custom footprint, verify it in the PCB layout editor before using it in a production design.
3. **Backup Designs**: Before applying scripts to an existing design, always create a backup. This is especially important for tasks that modify the layout or netlist.
4. **Scripting Documentation**: Clearly document your scripts with comments and explanations. This ensures that the scripts are understandable and maintainable in the future or by other team members.
5. **Adopt Community Standards**: When possible, follow KiCad scripting guidelines and community standards. This ensures compatibility and future-proofing for updates to KiCad.
6. **Incremental Automation**: Start by automating smaller, repetitive tasks and gradually work your way towards more complex automation projects. This helps you become familiar with KiCad’s scripting API and its capabilities.
