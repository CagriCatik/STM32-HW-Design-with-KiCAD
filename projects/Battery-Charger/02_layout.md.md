## **1. Assigning Footprints to Components**

### **1.1 Overview**

Each component in your schematic must be associated with a physical footprint, defining its physical dimensions and pad arrangement on the PCB. Accurate footprint assignment is crucial for proper component placement and soldering.

### **1.2 Footprint Selection**

- **Selecting Appropriate Footprints:**
  - **Accessing Footprints:**
    1. Open your schematic in **Eeschema**.
    2. Select the component and choose `Assign Footprints` from the `Tools` menu.
    3. Use the footprint library browser to locate and assign the correct footprint.
  - **Example: USB Connector Footprint:**
    - For a micro-B USB connector from Molex:
      - Reference the component’s datasheet to identify the correct footprint.
      - Search for Molex USB micro-B footprints in KiCad's libraries or import a custom footprint if necessary.
      - Verify dimensions, pad sizes, and pin assignments against the datasheet to ensure accuracy.

### **1.3 Adding Datasheets and Documentation**

- **Attaching Datasheets:**
  - While KiCad does not embed datasheets directly into the project, maintain a separate documentation folder with all relevant datasheets.
  - Link to datasheets within component annotations or maintain a naming convention that references the datasheet files, ensuring easy access during layout and assembly.

### **1.4 Footprint Best Practices**

- **Accuracy:**
  - Ensure footprints precisely match the component's dimensions and pad layout. Misalignment can lead to soldering issues or component damage.
- **Creating Custom Footprints:**
  - If a footprint is not available in KiCad’s libraries:
    1. Open **Footprint Editor** in KiCad.
    2. Create a new footprint based on the component's mechanical drawings from the datasheet.
    3. Verify pad spacing, sizes, and overall dimensions meticulously.

**Tip:**  
Choosing the correct footprint is critical. For hand-soldered designs, use larger SMD sizes (e.g., 1206) for easier handling. Smaller footprints (e.g., 0805 or 0603) are suitable for compact designs but may be challenging to solder manually.

## **2. Understanding SMD vs. Through-Hole Components**

### **2.1 Surface-Mount Devices (SMDs)**

- **Advantages:**
  - Smaller size enables compact PCB designs.
  - Suitable for automated assembly processes.
  - Generally offer better electrical performance for high-speed signals.
- **Common SMD Components:**
  - Capacitors, resistors, ICs, connectors.

### **2.2 Through-Hole Components**

- **Advantages:**
  - Enhanced mechanical stability, suitable for connectors or components subjected to mechanical stress.
  - Easier for prototyping and manual assembly.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Power connectors, large inductors, components requiring strong mechanical bonds.

### **2.3 Hybrid Designs**

Combining SMD and through-hole components leverages the advantages of both technologies. For instance, using SMD for signal components and through-hole for power connectors ensures both compactness and mechanical robustness.

**Best Practice:**  
Prefer SMD components for final production to benefit from space efficiency and automated assembly unless mechanical strength is a critical factor.

  2. Use `Tools` > `Update PCB from Schematic` (or click the corresponding button).
  3. Confirm to import all components and netlists, ensuring that all schematic elements are represented in the PCB layout.

### **3.2 Designing the Board Outline**

- **Defining Physical Boundaries:**
  1. In **Pcbnew**, select the `Edge.Cuts` layer.
  2. Use the `Add Graphic Line` or `Add Graphic Polygon` tools to draw the PCB outline.
  3. Ensure dimensions accommodate all components and connectors.

- **Considerations:**
  - **Connector Placement:** Position connectors (e.g., USB) at the board's edge for accessibility.
  - **Mounting Holes:** Include mounting holes if necessary, aligning with mechanical requirements.

**Best Practice:**  
Keep the board size as compact as possible while ensuring adequate space for components, routing, and thermal management.

## **4. Placement of Components**

### **4.1 Component Placement Guidelines**

1. **Input and Output Planning:**
   - **Inputs (e.g., USB):** Place near the board edge for easy access.
   - **Processing Section (IC and Capacitors):** Position centrally to minimize trace lengths.
   - **Outputs (e.g., Battery Connectors):** Arrange logically relative to inputs and processing sections.

2. **Power and Ground Considerations:**
   - Group power supply components together.
   - Position ground-related components near the ground plane or reference points.

3. **Thermal Management:**
   - Place heat-generating components (e.g., voltage regulators) to allow for adequate heat dissipation.
   - Avoid clustering heat sources to prevent thermal hotspots.

4. **Signal Integrity:**
   - Keep high-speed signal paths short and direct.
   - Avoid crossing different signal domains to minimize interference.

### **4.2 Decoupling Capacitors**

- **Placement:**
  - Place decoupling capacitors as close as possible to the power pins of ICs to minimize noise and stabilize voltage.
- **Multiple Capacitors:**
  - Use a combination of different capacitor values (e.g., bulk and high-frequency) for effective noise filtering.

### **4.3 Efficient Use of Space**

- **Proximity of Connected Components:**
  - Position electrically connected components close to reduce routing complexity and minimize trace lengths, improving signal integrity and reducing parasitic effects.

**Best Practice:**  
Follow a logical layout flow, grouping related components and ensuring that critical paths (power, ground, high-speed signals) are optimized for performance and reliability.

## **6. Routing the PCB**

### **6.1 Routing Strategy**

1. **Start with Power and Ground Nets:**
   - Route critical power (VCC) and ground (GND) nets first to ensure stable power distribution.
   - Use wide traces or copper pours for these nets to handle higher currents and reduce voltage drops.

2. **Signal Routing:**
   - Route sensitive signal lines next, keeping them short and free from interference.
   - Use appropriate trace widths based on current requirements and signal frequency.

3. **Minimize Crosstalk and EMI:**
   - Separate high-speed or high-frequency signals from noisy power lines.
   - Use differential pairs for certain signals if necessary.

### **6.2 Vias and Multiple Layers**

- **Using Vias:**
  - Utilize vias to connect traces between different layers, enabling more routing flexibility and reducing congestion.
- **Layer Stack-Up:**
  - Design a layer stack-up (e.g., top signal, ground plane, power plane, bottom signal) that supports efficient routing and minimizes signal interference.

### **6.3 Trace Width and Clearance**

- **Trace Width Calculation:**
  - Determine trace width based on current carrying capacity. Use IPC-2221 standards or online calculators for guidance.
- **Clearance Rules:**
  - Adhere to design rules for trace spacing to prevent short circuits and ensure manufacturability.

**Best Practice:**  
Follow a systematic approach to routing, addressing power and ground first, then moving to signal routing while maintaining trace integrity and compliance with design rules.
