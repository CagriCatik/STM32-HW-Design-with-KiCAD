## Routing

### 1. Power Routing

- **Wide Traces**: Use approximately 1 mm wide traces for power lines to handle higher currents.
- **Parallel Vias**: Multiple vias connect power traces to reduce inductance and ensure stable power delivery.

### 2. Signal Routing

- **High-Speed Signals**: Keep high-speed traces (e.g., SPI, USB, SWD) away from each other to minimize crosstalk.
- **Trace Widths**: Calculate based on impedance requirements using PCB manufacturer specifications and impedance calculators.

### 3. Impedance Matching

- **RF Traces**: Designed for 50 Ω single-ended impedance.
  - **Calculation**: Use PCB manufacturer's impedance calculator considering trace width and dielectric properties.
  - **Example**: For a 4-layer board with specific stack-up, a trace width of ~0.292 mm may be required for 50 Ω impedance.

- **USB Differential Pairs**:
  - **Differential Impedance**: 90 Ω.
  - **Trace Separation**: Typically 8 mils (0.203 mm) with trace widths of ~10 mils (0.254 mm).
  - **Length Matching**: Ensure both D+ and D- traces are of equal length to prevent signal skew.

### 4. RF Routing and Guard Rings

- **Guard Rings**: Surround RF circuitry with a copper pour connected to ground to shield against stray signals.
- **Separation from Other Signals**: Ensure no high-speed or digital signals run beneath or near the RF sections.
- **Crystal Placement**: Keep crystals isolated from high-speed traces and ensure dedicated ground planes beneath them.

### 5. Differential Pair Routing

- **USB Differential Pairs**: Use KiCad's differential pair routing tools to maintain consistent impedance and minimize skew.
- **Length Matching**: Utilize routing techniques to equalize trace lengths, ensuring signals arrive simultaneously at the receiver.

## Component Footprints

- **Surface Mount Devices (SMD)**: Prefer small SMD packages (e.g., 0402) for compactness, especially in RF sections.
- **Larger Components**: Use slightly larger footprints (e.g., 0603) for bulk capacitors and resistors handling higher currents.
- **Connectors**: Ensure accurate footprints for USB and SMA connectors to align with PCB edge cuts.

## Silkscreen and 3D Models

- **Silkscreen Enhancements**:
