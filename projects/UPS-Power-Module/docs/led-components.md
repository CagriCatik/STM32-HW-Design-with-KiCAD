# LED Circuit

This schematic represents a simple LED circuit with four LEDs (Led1, Led2, Led3, Led4), each driven by a corresponding voltage source and current-limiting resistors. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the components and their purposes:

### Key Components:

1. **LEDs (Led1, Led2, Led3, Led4)**:
   - **Description**: These are light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that will emit light when current passes through them. Each LED has a specific current-limiting resistor associated with it to protect the LED from excessive current.
   - **Connections**:
     - **Led1** is connected to **V1** (possibly a control signal or power rail).
     - **Led2** is connected to **V2** (which is shared with Led3 and Led4).
     - **Led3** is connected to **V3**.
     - **Led4** is connected to **V4**.
   - **Purpose**: LEDs provide a visual indication that some part of the circuit is active, or they could be part of a display or status system.

2. **Resistors (R4, R5, R6, R7 - 10kΩ each)**:
   - **Description**: These resistors limit the current flowing through the LEDs to protect them from drawing too much current and burning out. Each LED has its own current-limiting resistor.
   - **Purpose**: The resistors are essential for controlling the amount of current flowing through the LEDs. Without these resistors, the LEDs could draw too much current, causing damage.
   - **Values**: All the resistors are **10kΩ**, which suggests the LEDs are operating at relatively low currents (common in indicator or display applications).

3. **Voltage Sources (V1, V2, V3, V4)**:
   - **V1, V2, V3, V4** represent the voltages that drive the LEDs. These could be control signals or power sources from a microcontroller, logic circuit, or other power source.
   - **V2** is shared between multiple LEDs (Led2, Led3, Led4), indicating they might all be controlled by a single voltage rail or signal.

4. **PGND**:
   - **PGND (Power Ground)** is the common ground for the circuit. The return path for the current from the LEDs is connected to this ground.

### Purpose of the Circuit:
This is a basic **LED indicator circuit**. Each LED is controlled by a voltage source, and the resistors limit the current to each LED. The LEDs could be used as visual indicators, showing the state of a device (on/off), representing logic signals (such as status indicators on a control panel), or part of a larger display system.

### Relation to Previous Parts:
This circuit, like the one involving the SSD1306 driver, uses simple components like resistors and LEDs for visual indication or status reporting. The I2C-controlled OLED display from the earlier schematic could work alongside this LED indicator system, where the LEDs might indicate different states or operating modes while the OLED provides more detailed information. Both systems could be controlled by the same microcontroller or logic system, with the LEDs serving as quick status indicators for the operator.
