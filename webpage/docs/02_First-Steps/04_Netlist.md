# Generating the Netlist

The netlist is a critical file that details all electrical connections within your circuit. It serves as the bridge between the schematic and PCB layout, guiding the routing of traces on the PCB.

## Steps to Generate the Netlist

### Generate Netlist

- Access Netlist Generation:
  - In the Schematic Editor, navigate to Tools > Generate Netlist.
  
- Configure Netlist Options:
  - Select the desired netlist format (typically the default format is suitable for KiCad).
  
- Save the Netlist:
  - Choose a location within your project folder to save the netlist file, commonly named `project.net`.

> Best Practice: Regularly generate and save the netlist after significant schematic changes to keep the PCB layout updated.
