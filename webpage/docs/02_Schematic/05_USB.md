    - Select the **Shield** pin.
    - Press **Q** to assign the DNC property.

- **ID Pin**:
  - The **ID** pin is utilized in USB OTG configurations to switch roles between host and device.
  - In a device-only setup, this pin is irrelevant and should also be marked as **DNC**:
    - Select the **ID** pin.
    - Press **Q** to assign the DNC property.
