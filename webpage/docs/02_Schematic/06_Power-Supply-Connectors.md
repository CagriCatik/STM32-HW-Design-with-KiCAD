## 3. Adding a Status LED

A **status LED** serves as a visual indicator to confirm that the system is powered on. This simple addition enhances debugging and user interaction by providing immediate feedback on the system's power state.

### Step 1: Add the LED

1. **Add the LED Symbol**
   - **Search and Select**: Locate the **LED** symbol in KiCad's component library.
   - **Placement**: Place the LED on the schematic, positioning it near the power supply for logical grouping.

2. **Connect the LED**
   - **Anode Connection**: Connect the **anode** of the LED to the **3.3V power rail**.

### Step 2: Add a Current-Limiting Resistor

1. **Add the Resistor Symbol**
   - **Search and Select**: Find the **resistor** symbol in the component library.
   - **Placement**: Place the resistor in series with the LED's cathode.

2. **Determine Resistor Value**
   - **Value**: Use a **1.5kΩ resistor** (labeled as **1K5**).
   - **Current Calculation**:
     - **LED Forward Voltage (Vf)**: Typically **1.8V** for a red LED.
     - **Supply Voltage (Vcc)**: **3.3V**.
     - **Voltage Across Resistor**: **3.3V - 1.8V = 1.5V**.
     - **Current (I)**: **I = V/R = 1.5V / 1.5kΩ = 1mA** (suitable for indicator purposes).

3. **Connection**
   - **Series Placement**: Ensure the resistor is directly in series with the LED's cathode to limit current effectively.

### LED Voltage and Current Considerations

- **Forward Voltage (Vf)**: A standard **red LED** has a forward voltage drop of approximately **1.8V**.
- **Current Limiting**: A **1.5kΩ resistor** restricts the current to around **1mA**, which is sufficient for visible indication while minimizing power consumption.
- **Alternative Values**: Depending on the desired brightness, resistor values can range between **1kΩ** to **2kΩ**.

### Best Practices

- **Resistor Precision**: Use resistors with appropriate tolerance (e.g., ±1%) to ensure consistent LED brightness.
- **LED Orientation**: Verify the correct orientation of the LED to prevent reverse biasing, which can damage the component.
- **Component Selection**: Choose LEDs with suitable brightness and color for your application needs.
