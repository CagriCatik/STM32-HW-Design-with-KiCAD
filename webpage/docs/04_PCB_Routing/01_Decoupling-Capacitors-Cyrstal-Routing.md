## 1. Setting Up the Ground Plane

Establishing a robust ground plane is foundational to minimizing electrical noise and ensuring stable operation of sensitive components. For a two-layer PCB, the ground plane is conventionally allocated to the bottom layer, providing a low impedance return path for signals traversing the top layer.

### Step 1: Creating a Ground Plane

1. Select the Bottom Layer
   - Action: In KiCad’s PCB Editor, navigate to the bottom copper layer by selecting it from the layer selection toolbar.
   - Rationale: Positioning the ground plane on the bottom layer facilitates an unobstructed return path for signals on the top layer, enhancing signal integrity and reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI).

2. Create a Ground Fill Zone
   - Tool Utilization: Activate the Add Filled Zone tool using the shortcut SHIFT + CTRL + F.
   - Configuration:
     - Net Selection: Assign the zone to the GND net to ensure all ground connections are unified within this plane.
