# Checking Gerber Files Before Submission

Before submitting the Gerber files to your manufacturer, it’s important to visually check them using a Gerber Viewer to ensure everything looks correct.

## Step 1: Open Gerber Files in a Viewer

1. In KiCad, you can use the Gerber Viewer by going to File > Gerber Viewer.
2. Load all the Gerber files from your Manufacturing folder.

## Step 2: Inspect Each Layer

- Copper Layers: Verify that the copper traces, pads, and connections are correct.
- Silkscreen: Check that all text and labels are placed correctly and not overlapping with any pads.
- Solder Mask: Ensure that the solder mask openings are aligned with the component pads.
- Edge Cuts: Verify that the board outline is correct and matches your intended dimensions.
