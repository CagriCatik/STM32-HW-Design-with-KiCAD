# Submitting the Files for PCB Manufacturing

Once your design files are checked and ready, you can upload them to your PCB manufacturer’s website for production.

## Step 1: Upload Gerbers to Manufacturer

1. Go to the manufacturer’s website (e.g., JLCPCB or any other PCB fab service).
2. Choose the quote/ordering tool and upload your Gerber ZIP file (which contains all the Gerber files and drill files).
3. Check Gerber Files: Most manufacturers have an integrated Gerber viewer to visually inspect the files before confirming the order.

## Step 2: Specify Board Details

- Choose your desired PCB material (e.g., FR-4 fiberglass).
- Select the number of layers (usually 2 layers for simple designs).
- Specify the PCB color, finish type (e.g., HASL lead-free, ENIG), and board thickness.
- Choose the number of boards you want to order.

## Step 3: Optional PCB Assembly

- If you want the board fully assembled, you can upload the Bill of Materials (BOM) and Pick-and-Place file.
- Choose the side for assembly (e.g., Top, Bottom, or Both).
