# Design Automation

Python scripting in KiCad allows for the automation of the entire design process, from schematic capture through PCB layout, validation, and even documentation generation. This powerful feature enables users to manage complex workflows, streamline batch processes, and optimize designs iteratively for performance or manufacturability. Automating these tasks not only saves time but also helps reduce human errors, particularly when dealing with repetitive tasks or multiple designs.

## Why Automate the Design Process?

Automating the design process provides several significant benefits:

- Time Efficiency: By scripting repetitive tasks like component placement, routing, or netlist generation, designers can focus on high-level design decisions while automation handles the details.
- Consistency: Automated processes ensure that the same rules and procedures are applied across multiple designs, improving consistency and reducing the likelihood of errors.
- Design Optimization: Iteratively optimizing a design for various factors (e.g., signal integrity, manufacturability, or power consumption) can be automated to explore multiple configurations without manual intervention.
- Scalability: Automation is particularly valuable when managing large-scale projects or batch-processing multiple designs, as the same script can handle repetitive tasks for multiple boards with different configurations.

## Common Use Cases for Design Automation

### 1. Batch Processing Multiple Designs

In scenarios where multiple designs share common characteristics or components, Python scripting can be used to automate tasks such as generating netlists, running design rule checks (DRC), or exporting files across all designs simultaneously. This is especially useful for projects that involve creating variations of a base design or handling product families with different configurations.

Example Use Case:
- A company producing a family of similar devices (e.g., different versions of a microcontroller board) can use automation to quickly replicate design tasks across all variants, ensuring that every board is processed with the same steps.

### Example Code: Batch Processing Designs

```python
import pcbnew

def batch_process_designs(designs):
    for design in designs:
        pcb = pcbnew.LoadBoard(design)
        generate_netlist(pcb)
        run_drc(pcb)
        export_gerbers(pcb)

def generate_netlist(pcb):
    # Logic for generating netlist
    print(f"Netlist generated for {pcb.GetFileName()}.")

def run_drc(pcb):
    # Logic for running DRC checks
    print(f"DRC completed for {pcb.GetFileName()}.")

def export_gerbers(pcb):
    # Logic for exporting Gerber files
    print(f"Gerber files exported for {pcb.GetFileName()}.")

# Example usage
design_files = ["board1.kicad_pcb", "board2.kicad_pcb", "board3.kicad_pcb"]
batch_process_designs(design_files)
```

In this example, a script processes multiple designs (provided as a list of file names) by automatically generating netlists, running DRC checks, and exporting Gerber files for each board in the batch. This approach ensures consistent processing across all designs and reduces manual effort.

### 2. Iterative Design Optimization

For complex designs, you may need to iterate through various configurations to optimize for performance, manufacturability, or other design constraints. Python scripts can automatically modify design parameters, rerun validation checks, and evaluate results, making it easier to find the best solution without manually changing the design after each iteration.

Example Use Case:
- A designer working on a high-speed PCB might need to adjust trace widths, spacing, or layer stackups to improve signal integrity. Using a script, the designer can automate the process of adjusting these parameters and re-running simulations or validation checks until the optimal configuration is found.

### Example Code: Iterative Design Optimization

```python
import pcbnew

def optimize_design(pcb, iterations):
    for i in range(iterations):
        adjust_trace_widths(pcb, i)
        run_drc(pcb)
        evaluate_results(pcb)

def adjust_trace_widths(pcb, iteration):
    # Example logic to adjust trace widths based on iteration
    new_width = 0.3 + (iteration * 0.05)  # Increment width with each iteration
    for track in pcb.GetTracks():
        if isinstance(track, pcbnew.TRACK):
            track.SetWidth(int(new_width * 1e6))  # Set width in nm

def evaluate_results(pcb):
    # Example logic to evaluate DRC results or other criteria
    print(f"Evaluating design {pcb.GetFileName()}...")

# Example usage
pcb = pcbnew.LoadBoard("my_board.kicad_pcb")
optimize_design(pcb, 5)
```

This example adjusts the trace widths in each iteration, runs a design rule check, and evaluates the results to find the optimal design parameters. It automates the process of experimenting with different configurations, making iterative optimization faster and more consistent.

### 3. Automated Documentation Generation

Generating design documentation (e.g., schematics, layouts, BOMs, assembly instructions) is a critical part of the design process, especially when handing off designs to manufacturing teams or clients. Python scripts can automate the generation of these documents, ensuring they are up-to-date and accurate based on the latest design.

Example Use Case:
- A script could automatically generate a comprehensive set of design documentation (schematics, BOM, Gerber files, and assembly instructions) every time a new version of the board is saved. This ensures that documentation is always aligned with the design's current state.

### Example Code: Automating Documentation Generation

```python
import pcbnew

def generate_documentation(pcb):
    # Generate a schematic PDF
    generate_schematic_pdf(pcb)
    
    # Generate a BOM
    generate_bom(pcb)
    
    # Generate assembly instructions
    generate_assembly_instructions(pcb)
    
    # Export Gerber files
    export_gerbers(pcb)

def generate_schematic_pdf(pcb):
    print(f"Generating schematic PDF for {pcb.GetFileName()}...")
    # Add logic to export schematic as PDF

def generate_bom(pcb):
    print(f"Generating BOM for {pcb.GetFileName()}...")
    # Add logic to generate BOM

def generate_assembly_instructions(pcb):
    print(f"Generating assembly instructions for {pcb.GetFileName()}...")
    # Add logic to generate assembly instructions

def export_gerbers(pcb):
    print(f"Exporting Gerber files for {pcb.GetFileName()}...")
    # Add logic to export Gerber files

# Example usage
pcb = pcbnew.LoadBoard("my_board.kicad_pcb")
generate_documentation(pcb)
```

In this example, the script automates the generation of various design documents, including the schematic PDF, BOM, and assembly instructions. This ensures that all documentation is generated quickly and consistently without the need for manual intervention.

## Best Practices for Design Automation

### 1. Focus on Repetitive and Time-Consuming Tasks
When automating tasks, prioritize those that are repetitive, time-consuming, or prone to human error. Automating these tasks will save the most time and help maintain consistency across designs.

### 2. Ensure Flexibility in Scripts
Design automation scripts should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the design. For example, if you add a new component or change the board dimensions, the script should handle these adjustments without requiring significant modification.

### 3. Validate Automated Results
Always validate the results produced by automated scripts, especially when dealing with critical design parameters like trace widths, component placement, or routing. Automated processes can introduce errors if not thoroughly tested and validated.

### 4. Use Iterative Automation for Optimization
For tasks like design optimization, automation is most effective when used iteratively. Automate the process of adjusting design parameters, running validation checks, and analyzing the results to explore the best possible configuration.

### 5. Leverage Design Templates
If you frequently work on similar projects, consider creating design templates that can be automated through Python scripts. This reduces the need to start from scratch for each new project and ensures that key design standards are always followed.
