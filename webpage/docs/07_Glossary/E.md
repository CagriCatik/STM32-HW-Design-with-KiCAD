## ERC

ERC (Electrical Rule Check) is an automated analysis performed in schematic design to verify electrical correctness before PCB layout. It detects issues such as unconnected pins, conflicting pin types, missing power connections, and illegal net assignments. ERC enforces logical consistency between symbols and nets, reducing the risk of functional faults prior to layout and fabrication.

## ESR

ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) is the effective internal resistance of a capacitor when carrying alternating current. It models resistive losses arising from electrode material, electrolyte resistance, and lead or plate geometry. ESR directly affects how a capacitor behaves in high-frequency or high-current environments.

Low ESR supports stable voltage by minimizing droop during current spikes, improves high-frequency noise filtering by allowing faster current delivery, and reduces heat generation under load. High ESR degrades decoupling performance and can create unwanted resonances when combined with the capacitor's ESL. ESR is a critical parameter in power supplies, switching regulators, and decoupling networks.
