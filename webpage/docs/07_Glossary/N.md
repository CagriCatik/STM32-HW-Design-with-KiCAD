## NRST

NRST is the dedicated hardware reset pin on many microcontrollers, especially ARM Cortex-M devices. It provides an external means to force the device into a known startup state by driving the pin low. NRST requires a clean, glitch-free signal and is typically supported by an external pull-up resistor and optional RC filter to improve noise immunity. Debug tools use NRST to control device resets during programming and debugging sessions.
