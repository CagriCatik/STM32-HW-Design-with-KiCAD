## Pull-up (Internal)

A pull-up is a resistor that holds a signal at a stable logic high when nothing else is driving it. An internal pull-up means the resistor is built inside the microcontroller. It keeps the pin at a defined high level so it does not float. Floating signals cause unpredictable behavior.

## Pull-down

A pull-down is a resistor that holds a signal at a stable logic low. It prevents the pin from floating when no other circuit is driving it. With BOOT0, the pull-down ensures the pin stays low unless it is intentionally driven high.

## PCB

 (Printed Circuit Board) A board used in electronics to mount and connect electronic components.
