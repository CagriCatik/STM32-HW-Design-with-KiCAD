## SWD

Serial Wire Debug (SWD)

## Schematic

A diagram that represents the electrical connections and components in a circuit.

## SPI

Serial Peripheral Interface. A high-speed synchronous bus with master–slave architecture, used to connect sensors, displays, memory chips, and other peripherals.

## System bootloader

The system bootloader is a small program stored permanently inside the microcontroller by the manufacturer. It cannot be erased. It allows firmware upload using interfaces such as UART, USB DFU, CAN, or SPI depending on the model. When BOOT0 is set high, the MCU runs this loader instead of the user program.
